The RRSG committee is excited to launch **MR-pub - an online platform for interactive code demos** (living objects) and the first **competition for the development of living objects**!

MR-pub is here: [https://ismrm.github.io/mrpub/](https://ismrm.github.io/mrpub/). This new website is dedicated to interactive demos and complements MR-hub, which hosts MRI toolboxes. 

We invite you to participate in the competition by turning your work into a living object and submitting it for publication in MR-pub. Interactive objects can be (but are not limited to):

* Jupyter notebooks 
* Google collab notebooks
* Code ocean (executable code)

These living objects can be short demos highlighting some aspects of a published study/tutorial. For examples please see MR-pub.

Competition terms:

* The living interactive object must be related to specific contents published in the ISMRM 2021 Annual Meeting, such as an abstract or educational material.
* The submission deadline is **May 30, 2021**.

The award winners will be announced in the RRSG Business Meeting (June 3, 2021, 17:00 UTC), which is open to all the RRSG members.

The accepted living objects will be published in MR-pub and financial awards will be given to the first three winners.

We highly welcome your participation! Submitting your demo could be a wonderful opportunity to introduce your research to the MRI community. 

In order to submit your code demo, please fill this [registration form](https://forms.gle/FdyTbizSkHzqWFkR6), which requires submitting a link to the interactive demo.
