On June 3rd, 2021, the Reproducible Research Study Group had its annual business meeting. The new Committee was formed according to the results of the yearly elections, the results of the MR-Pub competitions were announced, and future projects were outlined.

## New Committee

**Martin Uecker** and **Kerstin Hammernik** rotated out of the *Past Chair* and *Trainee Representative* positions, respectively. Thank you very much for your work!

**Shaihan Malik** became the new *Secretary* and **Efrat Shimron** entered the group as *Trainee Representative*. Welcome and thank you for your commitment! The other members of the Committee rotated to their new positions. You can find the current composition of the committee in the [about page](/about).

## MR-Pub competition winners

First, we would also like to thank the 12 groups who submitted code demos to the competition. All the demos were highly interesting and informative, and we greatly appreciate everyone's efforts in submitting them. All the code demos will soon appear in MR-pub [https://ismrm.github.io/mrpub/](https://ismrm.github.io/mrpub/) - check them out!

Secondly, we are excited to announce the MR-Pub Competition winners: 

***Educational Demo Category***
**First place**: Reconstruction of Non-Cartesian Data - Jakob Assländer, NYU School of Medicine
**Second place**: Scientific computing with Python - Agâh Karakuzu, Montreal Polytechnique

***Research Demo Category***
**First place**: FastSurfer - a Fast and Accurate Deep-learning based Neuroimaging Pipeline - Leonie Henschel and Martin Reuter, Martinos Center, Harvard
**Second place**: Can Un-trained Networks Compete with Trained Ones for Accelerated MRI? Mohammad Zalbagi Darestani and Reinhard Heckel, Rice University

Congratulations to the awardees!

We welcome further submissions of interactive code demos to MR-pub. If you have an MRI-related demo and you would like to make it a public resource for the MRI community, please consider submitting it. 

## Planned future activities
The RRSG committee is looking into organizing a workshop (accompanied by a hackathon) in the **second half of 2022**. For this workshop the RRSG will join forces with the White Matter Study Group (WMSG), but the event will be open to reproducibility advocates from the broader MRI community. The tentative plan includes one day of presentations dedicated to reproducible research, followed by three days in which the hackathon and the WMSG sessions will run in parallel.

We highly welcome suggestions and ideas for this event. If you would like to get involved, please contact us by emailing rrsg.challenge@gmail.com .
