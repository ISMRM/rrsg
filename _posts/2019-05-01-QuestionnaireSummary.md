Many thanks to all who took the time to participate and to provide your feedback. It's clear that the ISMRM community, while it may not be hanging from quite such a high precipice as more statistics-driven fields, also has its fair share of reproducibility problems. 

This is probably the main take-home message from the whole survey:

The results from the rest of the survey highlight that there are a number of factors that could be improved within our field - ranging right through from the hardware itself (e.g. attempting to match pulse sequences across vendors), image reconstruction algorithms, image processing pipelines and validation of new methods in representative cohorts.
