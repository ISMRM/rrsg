title: Reproducibility Challenge #1 - Arbitrary SENSE
permalink: /challenge_one/
---

In April 2019 the RRSG challenged the ISMRM community to reproduce the results from a seminal paper in the field. The goal of this initiative is to select seminal papers from our field, and ask the community to reproduce the core findings/algorithms/implementations from these papers. The main motivation behind this initiative is to:

* Over time, create a library of standard reference implementations that can be used for comparison when publishing new methods.
* The ISMRM is currently creating educational content by curating educational lectures from past annual meetings and assembling them into online courses ([https://www.ismrm.org/online-education-program/](https://www.ismrm.org/online-education-program/)). An accompanying repository of reference implementations would be valuable additional content that the ISMRM research community could provide.
* Compare the individual submissions in terms of consistency of results, computation time and hardware/programming language requirements. Note: This is not to be intended to be a “ranking” of the submissions as would be done in a competition, but as an assessment of their variability.
* This initiative can be a great opportunity for students and trainees to gain additional visibility, especially if they come from smaller labs and countries where they do not have the opportunities to go to every ISMRM meeting and workshop to present their work to the research community.

The detailed submission instructions [can be found here for reference](https://blog.ismrm.org/2019/04/02/ismrm-reproducible-research-study-group-2019-reproduce-a-seminal-paper-initiative/).
